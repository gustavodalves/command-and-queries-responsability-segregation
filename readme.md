# Sample Project - CQRS Architecture

This is a sample project intended for educational purposes only and does not implement a real database or other complex functionalities. The structure of this project is based on the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architecture, an approach to software design that separates read operations (queries) from write operations (commands).

## Why Use CQRS?

CQRS is adopted to segregate concerns between reading and writing in a system. Here are some reasons to consider using CQRS:

1. **Specific Modeling**: CQRS allows you to model read and write operations separately, tailoring each to its specific requirements.

2. **Scalability**: With CQRS, you can scale the read and write sides independently. This is beneficial when one side requires more resources or processing power than the other.

3. **Flexibility**: The separation of queries and commands provides flexibility to choose different data storage mechanisms for read and write operations based on their respective needs.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a simple implementation of the CQRS architecture for educational purposes. It does not include a real database or complex business logic. The focus is on understanding the basic concepts of CQRS and how to separate queries and commands.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended solely for educational purposes, and the implementation lacks a real database or extensive functionalities. It serves as a starting point for learning about CQRS principles and should not be used in a production environment without appropriate enhancements and considerations.
